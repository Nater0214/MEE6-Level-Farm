I made this to farm MEE6 levels in a discord server with my friends. After people got mad at me I uploaded it to Github to mock them. Acutally use this it is usefull tho.

To use:
Just click on the message box and go afk. The keyboard inputs will keep your computer from shutting off, that wont be a problem.
